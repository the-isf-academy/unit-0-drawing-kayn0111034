# Assessment

When your project is finished (or before if it's helpful), assess your project. Read the [project rubric](http://cs.fablearn.org/projects/0-drawing project.html) and then decide how your project should score on each category. Write a paragraph for each category justifying this assessment with evidence from your code, planning documents, and commit messages.

## [A] Knowing, understanding, and computational thinking
### [A.iii] Controlling the flow of a program
**My achieves level project 7 expectations on this category. Here's why.**

My program successfully creates a visible picture in python using The turtle module. I used loops successfully to create curves, such as when drawing 'draw_inner_eye' & 'draw_outer_eye', as well as 'draw_main_hair1', 'draw_main_hair2', and 'draw_outer_hair1'.

I also decomposed my program a lot, as in the early versions of my commits, you can see that I did not define or make any functions aside from my 'setup' funtion that I took from my previous labs and homework tasks. By using functions, I was able to cut the amount of code I had a considerable amount (around 30% of my code) by making both sides that were mirrored a function.
I also decomposed by making a file to store my definitions (testingproject.py) and importing it into my main file project.py, which served as my final code.

An example of a detail that took a long time to get right, is the angles needed for creating my code. For example, in  inner_draw_headphones, the angles needed for the turtle to move in needed a lot of fixing by using math and protractors, and I had to test it a substantial amount of times of at least 10 tries before moving on to the other angles.
Another example is the use of the setup function for the code. My code uses the same function twice to mirror the pattern, and it needs a lot of use from the 'setup' function. It moves by the pixel, so when I mirror my functions, I need to test a lot for the x and y coordinates for the function to be able to mirror my previous function.
> Good and detailed description. I agree with your self-assessment of this criteria.

### [A.iv] Decomposition and abstraction
**My achieves level project 5 expectations on this category. Here's why.**
My image had a lot of different parts and steps I needed to accomplish to create this picture. I decomposed my program a lot, to get to the level of simplicity I have written. Originally, I had just written my code without any functions. Then, I cut my code in half so I could use a function to create the second half that is mirrored on my python drawing by using the 1 & -1 arguments on my variable, which creates a mirror image.
Each function has a clearly named variable, which in turn helps the programmer understand what the function does without actually running it. An example of this is the 'mini_mask_top' & 'mini_mask_bottom', which is the small mask inside the 'draw_big_mask_top' & 'draw_big_mask_bottom', so each functions could be understood on its own.
> You have clearly described how you decomposed your project and I think you should deserve a '6' here.

## [B] Planning and development
## [B.i] The proposal
**My project achieves level 5 expectations on this category. Here's why.**
My proposal talks about what my code actually does and it explains the what functions are needed, and how it is to be used.
> I agree your self-assessment. To write a good proposal, you could start by describing your problem statement in a sentence. Then you could conduct a research, e.g. any previous attempts on solving this problem? In this case, you can search how people have been using Turtle library to draw things and you should get as many different types of drawing as possible. Analyze how they coded the drawings. From this research and combine with your own personal interest, you can now propose a few ideas for your project. You should explain briefly these few ideas, their pros and cons in terms of criteria (such as technical, artistic...etc.) and how you would pick one out of them as your final project. Then you can start describing how you are going to execute this idea. For example, you could start sketching the idea out using a graph paper and pen and research the Turtle commands that could draw it. Now you can talk about how you would write the program using different skills - e.g. decompose it into smaller chunks by using functions, modules...etc. You should also include a timeline (in this case, milestones) to track the progress of your project. Use milestones to list all the critical stages and the dates expected to acheive those. If you miss a milestone, you should not just simply change it but to examine the reasons. It could be your time management skills, under-estimate the difficulities, or unexpected circumstances...etc. You can then outline a simple test plan - how do you measure your success? For example, if you are drawing is based on a drawing you found somewhere as a reference, is there a close resemblance between your Turle drawing and the reference drawing? Are your codes efficient? ...etc. Lastly, you can point out the shortcomings of your project and suggest some ideas for future improvements.


## [B.ii] Plans, milestones, and timelines
**My project achieves level 7 expectations on this category. Here's why.**
I used my milestone effectively by finishing what I planned in the halfway milestone before the half way mark. This shows that I checked what I needed to do and did what I wrote in there, accomplishing my milestone.
What I actually accomplished is similar to my scenario 1 timeline, so it shows that I follow both my timeline and my milestone effectively.
> I agree. 

## [B.iii] Documentation
**My project achieves level 7 expectations on this category. Here's why.**
My program has 7 commit messages on GitHub, explaining what I did and why I did it. It shows how I grew as a computer scientist, as in the first few commits, I did not make or use any functions aside from the 'setup' function I brought into the program from previous programs. Slowly, I added more and more functions, and I learned to decompose my program bit by bit and made 1 file to store my function definitions and import that to my project.py, where I actually run my functions.
> Good work on this.

## [B.iv] Personally meaningful project
**My project achieves level 8 expectations on this category. Here's why.**
I created this program with a clear vision in mind to draw a face in a helmet, and my design was inspired by games I play during my freetime. I refined the design after starting it by adding different colors to it that help make it look more aesthetically pleasing. I also expanded the functions I was going to use, and the end product is one that I am proud of, especially because I created it myself. Aside from the games I played, it was also inspired by me liking music and listening to music using headphones. Although this was inspired by these sources, it was not copied elsewhere and I am very proud of this design and it shows my creativity and self expression.
> I am glad to hear that this was a meaningful project to you! A '8' is well deserved.
