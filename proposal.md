# Proposal of the Plan

#### Wesley Chui 9Sc.2

## Project Idea

The project idea is to draw a face in a helmet, similar to Project Akali  from League of Legends

Below is a sketch of my design

## Composition
This would be split into 5 parts
Use fill
### Draw_Headphones( )
The original inspiration for this was cool looking headphones and therefore i named it that.

1. This would be drawn first so that I know how big the mask, eye and hair is supposed to be in contrast with the headphones.
2. The inside of the headphones will have another mini outline in it, which traces both sides to eye following the outer 'headphones' pattern (light blue and dark blue)

### Draw_mask( )
Since the end of the 'headphones' would be near to the mask, it would be completed 2nd to ensure that the whole helmet looks like it belongs there. (Black Color)

### Draw_hair( )

1. This would be the easiest part of this drawing with the main hairline coming down next to the eye.
2. This would be next to the 'headphones' on the top right and the right corner of the face, to add a slight curve to the it so this character doesn't look like it has a weird looking face.
3. This will be filled by a white color

### Draw_eye( )

This would have 2 parts to it.
1. The outer eye which has all the corners (black outline)
2. the ring of the circle would be black, while the inside would have a black pupil and a blue iris.

### Make_Sticker

If there is enough time, I could possibly do a sticker, but personally I don't think I will have enough time to do that.
(extension/depends on coding time required)

## Milestones

- **Milestone 0**: What will be finished when you are halfway done with the project? (When half the work time is used up, we will check in on our milestones and make changes to the project if necessary, to make sure we can finish on time.)

-**Halfway Milestone**:
Draw_Headphones and the Draw_mask should be finished and I should start Draw_hair and Draw_eye
